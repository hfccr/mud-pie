ENS like namespaces for MUD world and stores


MUD pie is a namespace protocol based on MUD world and stores. It allows players to claim unique names for themselves which can be used and imported by games built on top of MUD. This would allow players to use a unique handle across games in MUD. Players can also attach a profile picture to their handle.

A MUD table stores all the handles that have been claimed by users. The handle acts as the primary key in the table and other fields include owner, ttl, and about. Users can add a profile picture to their handle by using web3.storage. The frontend connects to chain id 4242 and the world address is 0x2a972e63c92bF6FcB8C7FB334Fca97f5968d08B4.
